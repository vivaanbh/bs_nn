# bs_nn
The Black-Scholes (BS) case study aims to develop a neural network model to approximate the nonlinear function of BS for financial option derivatives.

Contents:
- Data and Packages: use Tensor Flow to create the Neural Network (NN) model.
- Part A:
  1. Try models with different no. of layers (shallow and deep).
  2. Experiment with three activation functions - Relu, Sigmoid, and Tanh.
  3. Experiment with different numbers of neurons in hidden layers.
  4. Try different optimizers in Adam, Rsmsprop, and Momentum.
  5. Run multiple iterations (100, 500, 1000).

- Part B: Choose the best model in terms of MSE and convergence property.
- Part C: Repeat the analysis using the training-validation-test approach.

Please give the report a read for a better understanding of the project.
